/* 
PROBLEM
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). 
*/

/* UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- Given two sorted arrays, once merged, return the median.

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- Two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2.

3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- The median of the two merged arrays.

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
- Yes.

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
- Label the first array, second array, and median.
